# Selenium TestNG Java Framework

This repository contains a basic framework for automated testing using Selenium and TestNG in Java. The framework is designed to help you quickly set up and run automated tests for web applications.

## Features

- **Selenium WebDriver:** Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for web automation, allowing you to interact with web elements and perform various actions on web pages.

- **TestNG:** Integration with TestNG, a powerful testing framework for Java, providing features like parallel test execution, data-driven testing, and more.

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organize your test code using the Page Object Model design pattern for better maintainability and reusability.

- **Configuration Management:** Easily manage test configurations and environment-specific settings using property files.

- **Reporting:** Generate detailed test reports with TestNG's built-in reporting capabilities for test results analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven installed
- WebDriver binaries (e.g., ChromeDriver) compatible with your browser version

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-testng-java-framework.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd selenium-testng-java-framework
   
3. Update the configuration files in the src/main/resources directory with your test environment details, such as URLs, credentials, and WebDriver paths.
4. Create your TestNG test classes in the src/test/java directory using the Page Object Model approach.
5. Build the project:
   ```shell
   mvn clean install
6. Run your tests using Maven and TestNG:
   ```shell
   mvn test   
7. View the generated TestNG reports in the target/surefire-reports directory.
